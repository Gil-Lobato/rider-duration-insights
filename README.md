## 📌 Overview  
This project analyses rider behaviour in a city bike-share system, focusing on trip durations, station pairings, and temporal trends. It’s part of my data analytics portfolio, showcasing reproducible workflows, stakeholder-ready insights, and a structured approach to problem-solving.

## 🌟 Key Features  
- Cleaned and visualised trip data using R (ggplot2, dplyr)  
- Identified top station pairs and peak usage windows  
- Documented methodology using STAR framework  
- Hosted via GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing

## 🗺️ Coming Soon: Interactive Mapping  
Interactive geospatial visualizations are currently in development. Soon, users will be able to explore rider flows and station hotspots through dynamic Leaflet maps—designed to enhance stakeholder engagement and spatial decision-making.

Stay tuned for updates!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **R**: visualisation, mapping (ggplot2, Leaflet)  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, and manipulation through PowerQuery 
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting and version control
- **SQL**: Merged YoY data through a full join, and coalesced columns.
- **Markdown**: Documentation and reproducibility

## 🔍 Methodology  
- Standardized station names and filtered out anomalies  
- Ranked station pairs by frequency and average duration  
- Applied structured logic for scenario analysis  
- Used fallback strategies to handle missing or inconsistent data  
- Documented process for transparency and future iteration

## 📈 What I Learned  
- How to build scalable, reproducible analytics workflows  
- The value of structured documentation for stakeholder clarity  
- Techniques for geospatial mapping and interactive visualization  
- How to frame insights for operational and strategic impact

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Launch interactive mapping dashboard  
- Integrate predictive modeling for peak usage forecasting  
- Expand analysis to include clustering and underserved areas  
- Add real-time data integration via API
